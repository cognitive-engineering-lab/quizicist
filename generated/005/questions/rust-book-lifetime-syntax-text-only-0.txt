1. What is the main aim of lifetimes?
a. To prevent dangling references
b. To ensure references are valid
c. To compare scopes
d. To annotate relationships

2. How does Rust determine whether references are valid?
a. By using a borrow checker
b. By annotating lifetimes
c. By comparing scopes
d. By analyzing lifetimes

3. What is the significance of generic lifetime parameters?
a. They help Rust determine whether the reference being returned refers to x or y.
b. They describe the relationships of the lifetimes of multiple references to each other without affecting the lifetimes.
c. They ensure that the actual references used at runtime are definitely valid.
d. They prevent dangling references.

4. What is the syntax for lifetime annotations?
a. The names of lifetime parameters must start with an apostrophe (').
b. Lifetime annotations are placed after the parameter list, using a space to separate the annotation from the reference's type.
c. Most people use the name 'a for the first lifetime annotation.
d. All of the above.

5. What is the relationship between the lifetimes of the parameters and the return value in the longest function?
a. The return value will be valid as long as the parameters are valid.
b. The return value will be valid as long as one of the parameters is valid.
c. There is no relationship between the lifetimes of the parameters and the return value.
d. The return value will be valid as long as the lifetime of the longest string slice is valid.
