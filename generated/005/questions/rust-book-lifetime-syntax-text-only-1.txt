1. What is the main difference between a string slice and a string literal?

a) A string slice is a reference to a string, while a string literal is a string value.
b) A string slice is a piece of a string, while a string literal is a string value.
c) A string slice can be mutable, while a string literal cannot.
d) There is no difference between string slices and string literals.

2. What does the lifetime annotation 'a in fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str mean?

a) That the function takes two string slice parameters and returns the longest string slice.
b) That the function takes two string parameters and returns the longest string.
c) That the lifetime of the returned string slice is the same as the lifetime of the shorter of the two string slice parameters.
d) That the lifetime of the returned string slice is the same as the lifetime of the longer of the two string slice parameters.

3. What does the lifetime annotation 'a in struct ImportantExcerpt<'a> mean?

a) That the struct holds a string slice reference which must have the same lifetime as the struct.
b) That the struct holds a string reference which must have the same lifetime as the struct.
c) That the struct holds a string slice reference which must have a shorter lifetime than the struct.
d) That the struct holds a string reference which must have a shorter lifetime than the struct.

4. Which of the following code snippets would not compile?

a) 

fn main() {
    let string1 = String::from("abcd");
    let string2 = "efghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";

    let result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2);
    println!("The longest string is {}", result);
