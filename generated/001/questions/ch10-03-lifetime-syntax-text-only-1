1. What does the longest function return? 
A. The longest string 
B. A reference to the longest string 
C. A reference to the longest string, with a lifetime parameter 'a

2. What is the relationship between the lifetimes of the parameters and the return value? 
A. The returned reference will be valid as long as both the parameters are valid. 
B. The returned reference will be valid as long as the parameter x is valid. 
C. The returned reference will be valid as long as the parameter y is valid.

3. What does it mean when we specify the lifetime parameters in this function signature? 
A. We're changing the lifetimes of any values passed in or returned. 
B. We're specifying that the borrow checker should reject any values that don't adhere to these constraints. 
C. We're specifying that the borrow checker should accept any values that don't adhere to these constraints.

4. When annotating lifetimes in functions, where do the annotations go? 
A. In the function signature 
B. In the function body 
C. In the function signature and the function body

5. What is the lifetime of the reference in result if string1 and string2 have different concrete lifetimes? 
A. The lifetime of result will be the smaller lifetime of the two arguments. 
B. The lifetime of result will be the larger lifetime of the two arguments. 
C. The lifetime of result will be the same lifetime as string1.
