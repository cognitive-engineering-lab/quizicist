What does the longest function signature telling Rust?
A. That the lifetime of the reference returned from the longest function is the same as the lifetime of the smaller of the values of the function arguments
B. That the function takes two parameters, both of which are string slices that live at least as long as the lifetime of the function
C. That the function signature tells Rust to use the relationships when analyzing the code
D. That the lifetime of the reference returned by the longest function is the same as the lifetime of the values of the function arguments

Correct answer: B. That the function takes two parameters, both of which are string slices that live at least as long as the lifetime of the function.
Incorrect answer: A. That the lifetime of the reference returned from the longest function is the same as the lifetime of the smaller of the values of the function arguments
Incorrect answer: C. That the function signature tells Rust to use the relationships when analyzing the code
Incorrect answer: D. That the lifetime of the reference returned by the longest function is the same as the lifetime of the values of the function arguments

Question:
What is the lifetime of the reference in result must be the smaller lifetime of the two arguments?
A. The lifetime of the first argument
B. The lifetime of the second argument
C. The lifetime of the reference in result
D. The lifetime of the smaller of the two arguments

Correct answer: D. The lifetime of the smaller of the two arguments
Incorrect answer: A. The lifetime of the first argument
Incorrect answer: B. The lifetime of the second argument
Incorrect answer: C. The lifetime of the reference in result

Question:
Why is the return value lifetime is not related to the lifetime of the parameters?
A. The return value lifetime is not connected to the lifetime of the parameters at all
B. The return value lifetime must match the lifetime of one of the parameters
C. The data inside the return value must be related to the lifetime of the parameters
D. The return value lifetime is connected to the lifetime of the shorter of the two parameters

Correct answer: A.
