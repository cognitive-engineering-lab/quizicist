Another essential concept in coding is functions, which allow you to store a piece of code that does a single task inside a defined block, and then call that code whenever you need it using a single short command — rather than having to type out the same code multiple times. In this article we'll explore fundamental concepts behind functions such as basic syntax, how to invoke and define them, scope, and parameters.

  Prerequisites:  Basic computer literacy, a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, JavaScript first steps.    Objective:  To understand the fundamental concepts behind JavaScript functions.  


In JavaScript, you'll find functions everywhere. In fact, we've been using functions all the way through the course so far; we've just not been talking about them very much. Now is the time, however, for us to start talking about functions explicitly, and really exploring their syntax.
Pretty much anytime you make use of a JavaScript structure that features a pair of parentheses — () — and you're not using a common built-in language structure like a for loop, while or do...while loop, or if...else statement, you are making use of a function.
We've used functions built in to the browser a lot in this course.
Every time we manipulated a text string, for example:
const myText = 'I am a string';
const newString = myText.replace('string', 'sausage');
console.log(newString);
// the replace() string function takes a source string,
// and a target string and replaces the source string,
// with the target string, and returns the newly formed string

Or every time we manipulated an array:
const myArray = ['I', 'love', 'chocolate', 'frogs'];
const madeAString = myArray.join(' ');
console.log(madeAString);
// the join() function takes an array, joins
// all the array items together into a single
// string, and returns this new string

Or every time we generate a random number:
const myNumber = Math.random();
// the random() function generates a random number between
// 0 and up to but not including 1, and returns that number

We were using a function!
The JavaScript language has many built-in functions to allow you to do useful things without having to write all that code yourself. In fact, some of the code you are calling when you invoke (a fancy word for run, or execute) a built in browser function couldn't be written in JavaScript — many of these functions are calling parts of the background browser code, which is written largely in low-level system languages like C++, not web languages like JavaScript.
Bear in mind that some built-in browser functions are not part of the core JavaScript language — some are defined as part of browser APIs, which build on top of the default language to provide even more functionality (refer to this early section of our course for more descriptions). We'll look at using browser APIs in more detail in a later module.
Functions that are part of objects are called methods. You don't need to learn about the inner workings of structured JavaScript objects yet — you can wait until our later module that will teach you all about the inner workings of objects, and how to create your own. For now, we just wanted to clear up any possible confusion of method versus function — you are likely to meet both terms as you look at the available related resources across the Web.
The built-in code we've made use of so far come in both forms: functions and methods. You can check the full list of the built-in functions, as well as the built-in objects and their corresponding methods here.
You've also seen a lot of custom functions in the course so far — functions defined in your code, not inside the browser. Anytime you saw a custom name with parentheses straight after it, you were using a custom function. In our random-canvas-circles.html example (see also the full source code) from our loops article, we included a custom draw() function that looked like this:
function draw() {
  ctx.clearRect(0,0,WIDTH,HEIGHT);
  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.fillStyle = 'rgba(255,0,0,0.5)';
    ctx.arc(random(WIDTH), random(HEIGHT), random(50), 0, 2 * Math.PI);
    ctx.fill();
  }
}

This function draws 100 random circles inside a canvas element. Every time we want to do that, we can just invoke the function with this:
draw();

rather than having to write all that code out again every time we want to repeat it. And functions can contain whatever code you like — you can even call other functions from inside functions. The above function for example calls the random() function three times, which is defined by the following code:
function random(number) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random()*number);
}

We needed this function because the browser's built-in Math.random() function only generates a random decimal number between 0 and 1. We wanted a random whole number between 0 and a specified number.
You are probably clear on this by now, but just in case, to actually use a function after it has been defined, you've got to run — or invoke — it. This is done by including the name of the function in the code somewhere, followed by parentheses.
function myFunction() {
  alert('hello');
}

myFunction();
// calls the function once

Some functions require parameters to be specified when you are invoking them — these are values that need to be included inside the function parentheses, which it needs to do its job properly.
As an example, the browser's built-in Math.random() function doesn't require any parameters. When called, it always returns a random number between 0 and 1:
const myNumber = Math.random();

The browser's built-in string replace() function however needs two parameters — the substring to find in the main string, and the substring to replace that string with:
const myText = 'I am a string';
const newString = myText.replace('string', 'sausage');

Sometimes parameters are optional — you don't have to specify them. If you don't, the function will generally adopt some kind of default behavior. As an example, the array join() function's parameter is optional:
const myArray = ['I', 'love', 'chocolate', 'frogs'];
const madeAString = myArray.join(' ');
console.log(madeAString);
// returns 'I love chocolate frogs'

const madeAnotherString = myArray.join();
console.log(madeAnotherString);
// returns 'I,love,chocolate,frogs'

If no parameter is included to specify a joining/delimiting character, a comma is used by default.
If you're writing a function and want to support optional parameters, you can specify default values by adding = after the name of the parameter, followed by the default value:
function hello(name = 'Chris') {
  console.log(`Hello ${name}!`);
}

hello('Ari'); // Hello Ari!
hello();      // Hello Chris!

So far we have just created a function like so:
function myFunction() {
  alert('hello');
}

But you can also create a function that doesn't have a name:
(function () {
  alert('hello');
})

This is called an anonymous function, because it has no name. You'll often see anonymous functions when a function expects to receive another function as a parameter. In this case the function parameter is often passed as an anonymous function.
For example, let's say you want to run some code when the user types into a text box. To do this you can call the addEventListener() function of the text box. This function expects you to pass it (at least) two parameters:
the name of the event to listen for, which in this case is keydown
a function to run when the event happens.

When the user presses a key, the browser will call the function you provided, and will pass it a parameter containing information about this event, including the particular key that the user pressed:
function logKey(event) {
  console.log(`You pressed "${event.key}".`);
}

textBox.addEventListener('keydown', logKey);

Instead of defining a separate logKey() function, you can pass an anonymous function into addEventListener():
