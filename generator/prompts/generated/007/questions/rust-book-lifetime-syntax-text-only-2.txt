1. Why did the Rust team find that Rust programmers were entering the same lifetime annotations over and over in particular situations?

A. Because early versions of Rust required every reference to have an explicit lifetime annotation.

B. Because the Rust team predicted that certain patterns would emerge that would require explicit lifetime annotations.

C. Because the Rust team found that particular situations were predictable and followed a few deterministic patterns.

D. Because the Rust team programmed these patterns into the compiler's code so the borrow checker could infer the lifetimes in these situations and wouldn't need explicit annotations.


2. What does it mean when the compiler gets to the end of the three rules for lifetime elision and there are still references for which it can't figure out lifetimes?

A. The compiler will stop with an error.

B. The compiler will guess what the lifetime of the remaining references should be.

C. The compiler will figure out the lifetime of the remaining references using the lifetime elision rules.

D. The compiler will continue its analysis without requiring the programmer to annotate the lifetimes in the function signature.


3. Which rule specifies that the lifetime of the one input parameter gets assigned to the output lifetime?

A. The first rule

B. The second rule

C. The third rule

D. There is no such rule


4. In what situations does the third rule apply?

A. When there are multiple input lifetime parameters

B. When one of the parameters is &self or &mut self

C. When the lifetime of self is assigned to all output lifetime parameters

D. When the function is a method rather than a function


5. What does the 'static lifetime denote?

A. That the affected reference can live for the entire duration of the program.

B. That the affected reference can live for the duration of the program, but not necessarily the entire duration.

C. That the affected reference can live for a duration of the program that is shorter than the entire duration.

D. That the affected reference can live for
