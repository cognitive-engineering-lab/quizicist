1) What do methods defined within an impl block do?

A) they provide method syntax and prevent the caller from using the original instance after the transformation
B) they let you repeat the type of self in every method's signature
C) they provide access to an instance of a type's public API
D) they are associated with the type named after the impl keyword

2) What does the Self keyword do in an impl block?

A) it creates a new instance of the struct
B) it defines an associated function
C) it is an alias for the type that the impl block is for
D) it namespaces the struct

3) What is the difference between an associated function and a method?

A) an associated function is defined within an impl block and a method is not
B) an associated function is namespaced by the struct and a method is not
C) an associated function requires an instance of the type to work and a method does not
D) an associated function has the self parameter and a method does not

4) What is the difference between a getter and an associated function?

A) a getter is defined within an impl block and an associated function is not
B) a getter namespaces the struct and an associated function does not
C) a getter returns the value in the field and an associated function does not
D) a getter requires an instance of the type to work and an associated function does not

5) What is the purpose of multiple impl blocks?

A) to provide access to an instance of a type's public API
B) to keep associated pieces of data connected to each other
C) to let you repeat the type of self in every method's signature
D) to define functions that are associated with your type
