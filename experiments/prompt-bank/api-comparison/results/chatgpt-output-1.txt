In summary, a trait in Rust defines a set of behaviors that a type can have. The trait is defined using the keyword "trait" and the name of the trait. Inside the trait, the method signatures that describe the behavior are listed. Types can then implement this trait by providing their own custom behavior for the methods defined in the trait. This allows for shared behavior among different types and allows for generic types to be constrained to only those types that have the desired behavior. In the example provided, the Summary trait is defined and implemented on the NewsArticle and Tweet structs, providing a summary method for each type.
