In Rust, a trait is a way to define shared behavior between different types. Traits are defined using the "trait" keyword and consist of method signatures that describe the behavior of types that implement the trait. In the example provided, a Summary trait is defined that consists of a single method, "summarize", which takes a reference to self and returns a string. The NewsArticle and Tweet structs are then implemented to have the Summary trait, with custom behavior for the summarize method provided for each struct. This allows the media aggregator library to display summaries of data stored in a NewsArticle or Tweet instance by calling the summarize method on an instance.
