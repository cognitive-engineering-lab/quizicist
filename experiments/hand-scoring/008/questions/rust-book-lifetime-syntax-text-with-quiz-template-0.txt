 What does a lifetime annotation do?
A) It tells Rust how generic lifetime parameters of multiple references relate to each other.
B) It changes how long any of the references live.
C) It specifies the relationships of the lifetimes of multiple references to each other without affecting the lifetimes.
D) It declares the generic lifetime parameters inside angle brackets between the function name and the parameter list.

Correct answer: A) It tells Rust how generic lifetime parameters of multiple references relate to each other.
Incorrect answer: B) It changes how long any of the references live.
Incorrect answer: C) It specifies the relationships of the lifetimes of multiple references to each other without affecting the lifetimes.
Incorrect answer: D) It declares the generic lifetime parameters inside angle brackets between the function name and the parameter list.

Question: How do you add a lifetime annotation to a function signature?
A) By adding the generic lifetime parameters inside angle brackets between the function name and the parameter list.
B) By adding lifetime parameter annotations after the of a reference, using a space to separate the annotation from the reference’s type.
C) By adding a lifetime annotation to each reference.
D) By adding a lifetime annotation to the return value.

Correct answer: A) By adding the generic lifetime parameters inside angle brackets between the function name and the parameter list.
Incorrect answer: B) By adding lifetime parameter annotations after the of a reference, using a space to separate the annotation from the reference’s type.
Incorrect answer: C) By adding a lifetime annotation to each reference.
Incorrect answer: D) By adding a lifetime annotation to the return value.

Question: Why does Rust require us to annotate the relationships using generic lifetime parameters?
A) So the actual references used at runtime will definitely be valid.
B) So we can get comfortable with the concept.
C) So we can add a lifetime annotation to the return value.
D) So the borrow checker can perform its analysis.

Correct answer: A) So the actual references used at runtime will definitely be valid.
