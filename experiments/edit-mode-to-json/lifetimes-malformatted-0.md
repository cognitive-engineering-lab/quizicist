Question: Is it necessary to annotate every reference in a struct's definition with a lifetime annotation?
A) No, only references that will be used after the struct goes out of scope need to be annotated
B) Yes, all references in a struct's definition need to be annotated
C) No, only references that are borrowed from another reference need to be annotated
D) Yes, all references in a struct's definition need to be annotated with the same lifetime parameter

Correct answer: B
Incorrect answer: A
Incorrect answer: C
Incorrect answer: D

Question: Where do lifetime annotations go for a function?
A) In the function body
B) In the function signature
C) In the function parameters
D) In the return type

Correct answer: B
Incorrect answer: A
Incorrect answer: C
Incorrect answer: D

Question: What is the difference between a lifetime parameter and a concrete lifetime?
A) A lifetime parameter is a generic lifetime that can be substituted for any other lifetime, while a concrete lifetime is a specific lifetime
B) A lifetime parameter is a specific lifetime that cannot be substituted for any other lifetime, while a concrete lifetime is a generic lifetime that can be substituted for any other lifetime
C) A lifetime parameter is a generic lifetime that can be substituted for any other lifetime, while a concrete lifetime is a generic lifetime that can only be substituted for other generic lifetimes
D) A lifetime parameter is a specific lifetime that cannot be substituted for any other lifetime, while a concrete lifetime is a specific lifetime that can only be substituted for other specific lifetimes

Correct answer: A
Incorrect answer: B
Incorrect answer: C
Incorrect answer: D

Question: Which of the following will cause a compilation error?
A) Declaring a struct with a reference field that is not annotated with a lifetime parameter
B) Declaring a struct with a reference field that is annotated with a lifetime parameter
C) Calling a function with references that have different concrete lifetimes
D) Returning a reference from a function with a lifetime parameter that does not match the lifetime
