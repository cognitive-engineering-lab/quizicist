Question: Which of the following is not a reason to use generic lifetime parameters?
Correct answer: So references are valid as long as we need them to be
Incorrect answer: To prevent dangling references
Incorrect answer: To express the relationship between the lifetimes of the parameters and the return value
Incorrect answer: To ensure that a type has the behavior we want

Question: Which of the following will not compile?
Correct answer: fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
Incorrect answer: fn longest(x: &str, y: &str) -> &str {
Incorrect answer: fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &str) -> &str
Incorrect answer: fn longest<'a>(x: &str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str

Question: What is the main aim of lifetimes?
Correct answer: To prevent dangling references
Incorrect answer: To ensure that a type has the behavior we want
Incorrect answer: To express the relationship between the lifetimes of the parameters and the return value
Incorrect answer: So references are valid as long as we need them to be

Question: In Listing 10-18, why is x valid for the outer scope?
Correct answer: Because its scope is larger
Incorrect answer: Because its lifetime is longer
Incorrect answer: Because it is a reference
Incorrect answer: Because we annotated it with a generic lifetime parameter

Question: What does Rust use to compare scopes to determine whether all borrows are valid?
Correct answer: The Rust compiler has a borrow checker
Incorrect answer: We annotate the relationships using generic lifetime parameters
Incorrect answer: Lifetime annotations
Incorrect answer: Most of the time, lifetimes are implicit and inferred
