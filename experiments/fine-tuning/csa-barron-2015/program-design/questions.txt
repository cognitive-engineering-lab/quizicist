A certain freight company charges its customers for shipping overseas according to this scale: 
$80 per ton for a weight of 10 tons or less 
$40 per ton for each additional ton over 10 tons but not exceeding 25 tons 
$30 per ton for each additional ton over 25 tons 

For example, to ship a weight of 12 tons will cost 10(80) + 2(40) = $880. To ship 26 tons will cost 10(80) + 15(40) + 1(30) = $1430.

Consider the following program description:

A program is to be written that simulates bumper cars in a video game. The cars move on a square grid and are located on grid points (x, y), where x and y are integers between −20 and 20. A bumper car moves in a random direction, either left, right, up, or down. If it reaches a boundary (i.e., x or y is ±20), then it reverses direction. If it is about to collide with another bumper car, it reverses direction. Your program should be able to add bumper cars and run the simulation. One step of the simulation allows each car in the grid to move. After a bumper car has reversed direction twice, its turn is over and the next car gets to move. 19. To identify classes in the program, the nouns in the specification are listed: program, bumper car, grid, grid point, integer, direction, boundary, simulation 

How many nouns in the list should immediately be discarded because they are unsuitable as classes for the program? 
(A) 0 
(B) 1 
(C*) 2 
(D) 3 
(E) 4

• BumperCar will know its identification number, position in the grid, and current direction when moving. 
• GridPoint will be a position in the grid. It will be represented by two integer fields, x_coord and y_coord. 
• Grid will keep track of all bumper cars in the game, the number of cars, and their positions in the grid. It will update the grid each time a car moves. It will be implemented with a two-dimensional array of BumperCar. 

Which operation should not be the responsibility of the GridPoint class? 
(A*) isEmpty returns false if grid point contains a BumperCar, true otherwise 
(B) atBoundary returns true if x or y coordinate = ±20, false otherwise 
(C) left if not at left boundary, change grid point to 1 unit left of current point 
(D) up if not at top of grid, change grid point to 1 unit above current point
